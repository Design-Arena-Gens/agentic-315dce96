# Binance Early Pump Detector - Setup Guide

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Get Binance API credentials:
   - Visit: https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management
   - Create API key (read-only permissions are sufficient)

3. Create Telegram bot:
   - Message @BotFather on Telegram
   - Send /newbot and follow instructions
   - Get your chat ID from @userinfobot

4. Set environment variables:
   export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_key"
   export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_secret"
   export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="bot_token"
   export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your_chat_id"

5. Run the script:
   python binance_pump_detector.py

## How It Works

The script monitors Binance spot market and calculates pump probability scores based on:
- Volume spikes (3-5x increases)
- Price momentum and acceleration
- Order book buy/sell pressure
- Trade flow analysis (buyer vs seller aggression)
- Price consistency patterns

Scores ≥ 60/100 trigger Telegram alerts.

## Configuration

Edit binance_pump_detector.py to adjust:
- min_volume_spike (default: 3.0x)
- min_price_increase (default: 2%)
- scan_interval (default: 5 seconds)
- Score thresholds
